This is a fork of the Sparkle Kodi plugin that can be used to find acestream links from the Soccerstreams subreddit.

N.B. You need Plexus (and Acestream) installed in Kodi to use it.

Simply download the ZIP folder to the Kodi device, then install from Addons -> Install from zip file

This version is purely for acestream links posted in /r/soccerstreams.

This addon does not provide any content whatsoever, it is merely a method of scraping acestream links into Kodi to save copy/pasting them into Plexus.
