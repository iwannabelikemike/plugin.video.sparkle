This is a fork of the Sparkle Kodi plugin that can be used to find acestream links from the Soccerstreams subreddit. Note that you need Acestream and Plexus installed in Kodi to use it.

This version is purely for acestream links posted in /r/soccerstreams. This addon does not provide any content, it is merely a method of scraping acestream links into Kodi to save copy/pasting them into Plexus.
